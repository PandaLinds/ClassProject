Monitor:
-Commenting is not to coding standards.
-There are some uses of "magic" numbers in module code.
-Client, server, and monitor currently does not integrate. 
 Server code is able to accept client code and log,
 but client code can not send data. Monitor is not fully 
 developed, but can function on its own. 
-There is some error handling to localization, but it is
 underdeveloped, and will need perfecting.  
-Adding explicit destructors helped with the memory leak,
 but there may still be issues with this.Monitor:
